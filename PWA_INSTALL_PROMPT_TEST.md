## ⚠️ Important Requirements

### 1. HTTPS Required (Production)
- **Development (localhost):** Works without HTTPS ✅
- **Production:** MUST use HTTPS for install prompt to show
- Deployment platforms (Netlify/Vercel) provide HTTPS automatically

### 2. Engagement Criteria
Browser only shows install prompt after:
- Visit site at least 2 times
- Spend some time on site (usually 30+ seconds)
- Not dismissed prompt before

### 3. Testing Tips
- Clear browser cache if needed (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Visit site multiple times
- Stay on site for a minute
- Look for install icon in address bar (desktop)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Install prompt not showing?

**Desktop:**
```javascript
// Open DevTools → Console
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(console.log);
// Should show your service worker

// Check manifest
document.querySelector('link[rel="manifest"]').href
// Should return your manifest

// Force install prompt (Chrome)
// Go to chrome://flags
// Search "PWA" and enable "Desktop PWA install"
```

**Mobile:**
- Check if HTTPS (production needed)
- Visit site multiple times
- Use Chrome menu manually

### Service Worker not registering?

Check browser console (F12) for errors:
- Service worker file not found? → Check file exists at `/service-worker.js`
- Icons not loading? → Verify PNG files are actual images
