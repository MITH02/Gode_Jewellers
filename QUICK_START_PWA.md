# Quick Start: Fix PWA Install Prompt

## Issue: Install prompt not showing on mobile

The main reasons are resolved, but you need to **generate the icon files**.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Generate Icons (2 minutes)

1. Open in browser: `public/icons/generate-icons.html`
2. Click "Choose File" and select: `public/logos/Gode_Jwellers_Logo.jpg`
3. Click "Generate Icons"
4. Download **both** icons:
   - `icon-192x192.png`
   - `icon-512x512.png`
5. Copy both files to `public/icons/` folder

### Step 2: Test PWA

1. Run: `npm run dev`
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Application tab → Manifest
4. Check all icons show "Valid"
5. Go to Application tab → Service Workers
6. Should show "activated and running"

### Step 3: Test Install Prompt

**Desktop Chrome:**
- Look for install icon (⊕) in address bar
- Or: Settings → Install Gode Jewellers

**Mobile:**
- Open in Chrome mobile browser
- Menu (⋮) → "Add to Home screen"
- Or: Share button → "Add to Home Screen"

### Step 4: Fix Backend Error

```bash
cd backend
mvn clean install
```

Then restart your IDE/application.

## Current Status

✅ manifest.json - Fixed syntax error
✅ service-worker.js - Implemented
✅ index.html - Updated with meta tags
❌ Icon files - **YOU NEED TO GENERATE THESE**

## What Changed

1. Fixed manifest.json syntax error (`,n dev` removed)
2. Created icon generator tool
3. Created troubleshooting guide

## File Locations

- Icons will be: `public/icons/icon-192x192.png` and `icon-512x512.png`
- Generate using: `public/icons/generate-icons.html`
- Documentation: `PWA_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## Testing Checklist
